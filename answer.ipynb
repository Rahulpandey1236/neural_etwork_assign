    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which itself is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI). It involves training algorithms, particularly neural networks, to recognize patterns and make decisions by processing large amounts of data. In deep learning, the model consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, enabling it to learn complex representations of data. It's used for tasks like image and speech recognition, language processing, and autonomous driving. Deep learning is a powerful tool within AI, allowing machines to perform tasks that traditionally required human intelligence."
